Foliage is a way to add many instances of a collection of [[Static Mesh|Static Meshes]] easily.
Adding Foliage is done with the Foliage mode.
In this mode we can paint foliage into our level.

To add foliage first create a **Static Mesh Foliage** with Content Drawer > Foliage > Static Mesh Foliage.
Static Mesh Foliage contains a Mesh property that should be set to the [[Static Mesh Asset]] that should be instanced.

Static Mesh Foliage types can be added to the foliage list in the Paint tab of the Foliage panel.
Below the foliage list you can set various parameters for the currently selected foliage.
Examples of parameters are density, scale, random rotation, and Z Offset.

Add foliage instances to the level by activating one or more foliage types by enabling the checkbox in the foliage list and then click-and-drag in the Viewport.
Remove foliage instances by holding Shift while painting.

Note the difference between "selecting" and "activating" a foliage type.
Selecting means that its properties are shown below the foliage list.
Activating means that instances of the foliage type is created when painting.

The density settings for each foliage type can be scaled while painting by changing Brush Options > Paint Density.
