I shadowing method that renders shadows onto textures and then map those textures onto the [[Mesh]] that receives the shadow.
Used by [[Cascaded Shadow Maps]].
Shadow map settings are configured per [[Static Mesh Asset]] in the [[Static Mesh Editor]].
Shadow Maps are a subset of, or an effect of, [[Lightmap]].
This means that the [[Lightmap]] settings, such as size, effect the Shadow Map for that object.
