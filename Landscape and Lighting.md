#Landscape
#Lighting

A newly created Landscape in a default level will have shadow artifacts around the Landscape Components until lighting has been built.
To make [Sculpting](./Sculpt%20a%20Landscape.md) easier we can tweak the lighting settings to get rid of them.

# Directional Light
Select the Directional Light, named Light Source, and switch Mobility from Stationary to Movable.
The shadow artifacts will disappear.
It can be changed back to Stationary again, the artifacts will not reappear.

# Sky Light
In the default level there is a Sky Light with Mobility set to Static.
Set this to Stationary to have ambient lighting in areas in shadow from the Directional Light while sculpting.
