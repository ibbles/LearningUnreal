A Blueprint Type is any type that is exposed and usable in [[Blueprint]] with the `BlueprintType` specifier.
This includes classes with the [[UCLASS]] decorator and `BlueprintType` [[Class Specifier]], structs with the [[USTRUCT]] decorator and `BlueprintType` [[Struct Specifier]], and enums with the [[UENUM]] decorator.
