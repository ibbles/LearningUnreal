A Player Controller is a type of [[Controller]].
It may be possessing, i.e. controlling, a [[Pawn]].
We can get access to that [[Pawn]] with the Get Controlled Pawn node.
In C++ we call the `AController::GetPawn` function.
We can check if a particular [[Pawn]] is controlled by a Player Controller with the Is Player Controlled node.
Inside a [[Pawn]] we get find the current Player Controller with the Get Controller node and a [[Cast|cast]].
We can get a Player Controller from anywhere with the Get Player Controller node.
In that case we must know the index of the Player Controller we want.

A Player Controller has a [[HUD]] that we can access with the Get HUD node.

# Input Events
The Player Controller will receive [[Input Events]] generated by the [[Input Bindings]] configured at [[Project Settings]] > Engine > Input > Bindings.

# Mouse Cursor
The Player Controller is in control of the [[Mouse]] cursor.


## Show Mouse Cursor
Details panel > Mouse Interface > Show Mouse Cursor controls if the mouse cursor should be rendered or not.

## Get Hit Result Under Cursor By Channel
A Player Controller has access to the Get Hit Result Under Cursor By Channel function.
This uses the mouse cursor to do a line trace into the scene.
From the Hit Result we get a Location, which is in world space.
