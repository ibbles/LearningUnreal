The Unreal Marketplace is a place where Epic Games and other contributors can sell and distribute assets, projects, and plugins.
You can browse and purchase items at https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/.
Becoming a seller is a bit of a process, but buying items only require an Epic Games account.
The Epic Games account can be linked to a number of sign-in services, such as Google, Facebook, and many more.

Downloading from the Unreal Engine marketplace is done with the Epic Games Launcher on Windows and unsupported on Linux.
There are a few third-party Unreal Marketplace clients, such as [Epic Asset Manager](https://acheta.games/epic-asset-manager/) , [Heroic Game Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher), and [Legendary](https://github.com/derrod/legendary).
Neither work to a satisfactory degree as of 2022-04-02.
Epic Asset Manager has a 50/50 chance of successfully downloading items, and Heroic Game Launcher [don't have any developer anymore](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/issues/985#issuecomment-1046235524).
I haven't tried Legendary yet.
