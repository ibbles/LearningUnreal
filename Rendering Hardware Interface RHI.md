An application software layer that the rest of the rendering engine talks through to use rendering hardware with a particular set of features.
For example, there is a Rendering Hardware Interace for DirectX 11, another for DirectX 12, and so on.
The selection may be more granular that DirectX versions and we often talk about [[Shader Model]] versions rather than DirectX, or OpenGL, or Vulkan versions.
Which [[Shader Model]]s a particular project supports is selected in the [[Project Settings]], at Platforms > Linux or Windows > Targeted Shader Formats.
