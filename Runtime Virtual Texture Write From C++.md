Short-form:
- Create a Runtime Virtual Texture asset in the Content Browser.
	- This makes sense. A [[Runtime Virtual Texture]] is an asset so by creating one we get an object to write into.
- Using a [[Runtime Virtual Texture]] include [[Actor|Actors]], [[Runtime Virtual Volume]] (Name?), and [[Runtime Virtual Material|Runtime Virtual Materials]] (Name?).
- Implement a Runtime Virtual Texture Producer in C++ by inheriting from `URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent`.
	- I assume this is where we define what color each texel should be.
- Add the Runtime Virtual Texture Produce to an [[Actor]].
- Assign the [[Actor]] to the Virtual Texture property of the [[Runtime Virtual Volume]].

Let's sanity check this.

Does the `URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent` class exists?
Yes, see the [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Components/URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent/).
> Component used to place a `URuntimeVirtualTexture` in the world.
This sounds more like something that a Runtime Virtual Volume would use, not the texel data producer.

It's duplicating references a bit here.

>According to the Unreal Engine documentation12, a URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent is a component used to place a URuntimeVirtualTexture in the world. A URuntimeVirtualTexture is an asset that defines the properties and settings of a runtime virtual texture.

Then, you need to add the component to an Actor and position it in the scene where you want to render the runtime virtual texture3.

// Include the header file for URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent
#include "Components/RuntimeVirtualTextureComponent.h"

// Create a new Actor class that inherits from AActor
class ARVTActor : public AActor
{
    // Declare a constructor
    ARVTActor();

    // Declare a pointer to a URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent

    URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent* RVTComponent;

    URuntimeVirtualTexture* RVTAsset = LoadObject<URuntimeVirtualTexture>(nullptr, TEXT("/Game/MyRVT.MyRVT"));

    // Assign the asset to the Virtual Texture property of the component

Prompt:
>Can you add a member function to the Actor that writes a checkerboard pattern to the Runtime Virtual Texture asset?

Reply:
>Sure, I can try to generate some code for you.ðŸ˜Š

>To write a checkerboard pattern to the Runtime Virtual Texture asset, you need to implement a custom Runtime Virtual Texture Producer component that overrides the PopulateVirtualTexture method. This method is called by the engine when it needs to write data to the runtime virtual texture.

>Here is an example of how to create and use a custom Runtime Virtual Texture Producer component in C++:
```cpp
// Include the header file for URuntimeVirtualTextureProducer
#include "VT/RuntimeVirtualTextureProducer.h"

// Create a new component class that inherits from URuntimeVirtualTextureProducer
class UCheckerboardRVTProducer : public URuntimeVirtualTextureProducer
{
    // Declare a constructor
    UCheckerboardRVTProducer();

    // Override the PopulateVirtualTexture method
    virtual void PopulateVirtualTexture(URuntimeVirtualTexture* InRuntimeVirtualTexture, const FRuntimeVirtualTextureContext& InContext) override;
};

// Define the constructor
UCheckerboardRVTProducer::UCheckerboardRVTProducer()
{
    // Set the output type of the component to BaseColor
    // Note: You can change this to match your runtime virtual texture asset settings
    OutputType = ERuntimeVirtualTextureMaterialType::BaseColor;
}

// Define the PopulateVirtualTexture method
void UCheckerboardRVTProducer::PopulateVirtualTexture(URuntimeVirtualTexture* InRuntimeVirtualTexture, const FRuntimeVirtualTextureContext& InContext)
{
    // Get the size of the runtime virtual texture in pixels
    int32 RVTWidth = InRuntimeVirtualTexture->GetWidth();
    int32 RVTHeight = InRuntimeVirtualTexture->GetHeight();

    // Get the size of each tile in pixels
    int32 TileWidth = InContext.TileSize.X;
    int32 TileHeight = InContext.TileSize.Y;

    // Get the coordinates of the top-left corner of the tile in pixels
    int32 TileX = InContext.TilePosition.X * TileWidth;
    int32 TileY = InContext.TilePosition.Y * TileHeight;

    // Loop through each pixel in the tile
    for (int32 Y = 0; Y < TileHeight; Y++)
    {
        for (int32 X = 0; X < TileWidth; X++)
        {
            // Calculate the coordinates of the pixel in the runtime virtual texture
            int32 RVTX = TileX + X;
            int32 RVTY = TileY + Y;

            // Calculate the color of the pixel based on a checkerboard pattern
            // Note: You can change this to any pattern you want
            bool IsBlack = ((RVTX / 8) % 2) == ((RVTY / 8) % 2);
            FLinearColor Color = IsBlack ? FLinearColor::Black : FLinearColor::White;

            // Write the color to the runtime virtual texture
            InRuntimeVirtualTexture->WriteToChannel(InContext, ERuntimeVirtualTextureMaterialType::BaseColor, Color);
        }
    }
}

// Modify the ARVTActor class to use the custom component instead of URuntimeVirtualTextureComponent
class ARVTActor : public AActor
{
    // Declare a constructor
    ARVTActor();

    // Declare a pointer to a UCheckerboardRVTProducer component
    UPROPERTY()
    UCheckerboardRVTProducer* RVTProducer;
};

// Define the constructor
ARVTActor::ARVTActor()
{
    // Create a new UCheckerboardRVTProducer component and attach it to the root component of the Actor
    RVTProducer = CreateDefaultSubobject<UCheckerboardRVTProducer>(TEXT("RVTProducer"));
    RVTProducer->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);

    // Load a URuntimeVirtualTexture asset from the Content Browser
    // Note: You need to replace "MyRVT" with the name of your asset
    URuntimeVirtualTexture* RVTAsset = LoadObject<URuntimeVirtualTexture>(nullptr, TEXT("/Game/MyRVT.MyRVT"));

    // Assign the asset to the Virtual Texture property of the component
    RVTProducer->SetVirtualTexture(RVTAsset);
}
```

This looks promising, but there is no class named `URuntimeVirtualTextureProducer` in Unreal Engine, and no function named `PopulateVirtualTexture`.
At least the documentation search function on [docs.unrealengine.com](docs.unrealengine.com) doesn't find any.
But is also doesn't find [`URuntimeVirtualTexture`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/VT/URuntimeVirtualTexture/), which do exists, so I don't know anymore.
I don't trust anything anymore.
Except maybe for `grep` and a working copy of the Unreal Engine source code.
