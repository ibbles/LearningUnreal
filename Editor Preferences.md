An Editor Setting is a setting that only affects the Unreal Editor, not the engine or game.

The editor settings are edited from [[Top Menu Bar]] > Edit > Editor Preferences.

Blueprint created [[Actor Component|Actor Components]], those created with Add Component nodes in a [[Blueprint Visual Script]], such as the Construction Script, are hidden from the [[Details Panel]] by default.
They can be shown by disabling Content Editors > Blueprint Editor > Hide Construction Script Components In Details View.


# General

## Appearance

Settings for themes and colors.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Check or set the keyboard shortcuts for the editor.
This is not for the game, those shortcuts are controller with [[Input Event]] and [[Input Bindings]].

## Performance

Enable Show Frame Rate And Memory to have some performance statistics show up in the top-right corner of the main editor window.

By default the editor reduces CPU usage when it does not have focus, which tanks the framerate and performance.
Disable this behavior by disabling Use Less CPU When In Background.

# Level Editor

## Play

Set what size a new [[Viewport]] created for [[Play In Editor]] should have.
Set command line parameters that should be passed when launching a stand-alone session.


## Viewports

Set the snapping steps used when dragging things with the [[Transform Gizmo]] in the [[Level Viewport]]
