An Editor Setting is a setting that only affects the Unreal Editor, not the engine or game.
The editor settings are edited from [[Top Menu Bar]] > Edit > Editor Preferences.


# General

## Appearance

Settings for themes and colors.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Check or set the keyboard shortcuts for the editor.
This is not for the game, those shortcuts are controller with [[Input Events]] and [[Input Bindings]].

## Performance

Enable Show Frame Rate And Memory to have some performance statistics show up in the top-right corner of the main editor window.


# Level Editor

## Play

Set what size a new [[Viewport]] created for [[Play In Editor]] should have.
Set command line parameters that should be passed when launching a stand-alone session.


## Viewports

Set the snapping steps used when dragging things with the [[Transform Gizmo]] in the [[Level Viewport]]
