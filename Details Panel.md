The Details panel is where the [[Properties]] of an Unreal Engine object can be viewed and edited.
It is organized into two columns and sections called categories.
Many different types of objects have a Details panel: [[Actor]], [[Actor Component]], [[Material]], [[Static Mesh Asset]], [[Skeletal Mesh]], [[Blueprint Function]], and many, many more.
