Unreal Editor is the main editor for Unreal Engine projects.
This is where we create our [[Level|Levels]] with the [[Level Editor]], edit our [[Blueprint Class|Blueprints]] with the [[Blueprint Actor Editor]], design our [[Material|Materials]] with the [[Material Editor]], and so on for a bunch of [[Asset]] types.
Assets created in other authoring tools, such as Blender, Gimp, or Krita, are imported into Unreal Editor.


# Panels

## Tabs

The Unreal Editor is built up of panels.
Panels shows up as tabs in Unreal Editor.
The panes can be moved around within the editor window, and even moved out to separate windows.
To move a panel, click and drag the panels tab where the name is shown.
Place it near the edge of another panel to dock the dragged panel next to, above, or below the other panel.
Place it on top of another panel's tab to place the dragged panel on top of the other panel,
making it possible to switch between them.
Drag it in the  middle of a panel or outside any panel to create a new window for the dragged panel.

Tab / panel names can be hidden.
To hide a tab / panel name right-click the tab / panel name and select Hide Tabs.
They are then replaced by a blue triangle in the top-left corner of the panel.
Click the blue triangle to show the tab / panel name again.

Panels are closed by clicking the cross-button on the tab / next to the panel name.
Most panels can be re-opened from [[Top Menu Bar]] > Window.


## Sidebar

The sidebar is a collection of hidden but easily accessible panels on  the side of the Unreal Editor.
There is one sidebar on either side of the main Unreal Editor window.
Add a panel to the side bar by right-click tab / panel name > Dock To Sidebar.
It will go to the sidebar on the side the panel was docked to.
(
Not sure what will happen if we do this with a panel in the middle of the main window,
or one that spans the entire width.
)
Panels in the sidebar are hidden by default, shown when selected, and hidden again when unselected.
Panels in the sidebar can be pinned, meaning that they stay open even when unselected.
The purpose is to provide additional screen real-estate to other panels.
