An [[Editor Mode]] used to assign [[Vertex Color]] to vertices on a mesh.
Used much like any paint program, select a color, a brush size and strength, and click-and-drag over the selected mesh.

Setting a color controls the maximum level painting will reach.
This is good to prevent overblown blends

Cannot be used on [[Nanite]] meshes.

Type `x` or hold `Shift` to switch between the foreground and background color.
