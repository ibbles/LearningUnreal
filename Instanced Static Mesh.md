Instanced Static Mesh means that a [[Static Mesh Asset]] is rendered multiple times in different locations.
This renders faster than having a bunch of separate mesh instances.
(
I assume.
Is this still true?
Even with [[Nanite]]?
)
On way to is to use an [[Instanced Static Mesh Component]].
Another is to paint [[Foliage]] in the [[Foliage Mode]].
