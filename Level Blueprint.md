A Level Blueprint is a Blueprint associated with a particular level.
It is not a [[Blueprint Class]], just an [[Event Graph]], [[Blueprint Function|Blueprint Functions]], and [[Blueprint Variable|Blueprint Variables]].

The events within a Level Blueprint executes within the context of an instance of that level.
This means that it has access to and can manipulate object instances in the level.
To create a reference to any object in the level select the object in the [[Level Viewport]], right-click the Level Blueprint [[Node Graph Editor]], and select Create A Reference To NAME.
You can also create [[Blueprint Event|Blueprint Events]] or call functions from the same menu.
