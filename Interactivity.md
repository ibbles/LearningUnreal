Interactivity means letting the player cause change in the game world.
It is the building blocks for gameplay.


# Triggering actions
# Overlap
One way to trigger an action is to listen for Begin and End Overlap events in a [[Blueprint Class]].
The volume to overlap with is often defined with a Collision Component, such as a Box or a Sphere.
An overlap event [[Blueprint Event]] node can be added to the [[Event Graph]] by right-click the Collision Component > Add Event > Add On Component Begin Overlap.
