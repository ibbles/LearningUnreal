A Viewport is a window in which something is rendered.
The big area in the middle of the Unreal Editor is the main [[Level Viewport]].
Many sub-editors, such as [[Blueprint Editor]],  [[Static Mesh Editor]] and [[Material Editor]] also contain viewports displaying the opened [[Asset]].

Many viewports support the same set of [[Viewport Camera Controls]].
