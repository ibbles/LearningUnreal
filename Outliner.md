A panel that shows all the [[Actor|Actors]] that exist within a [[Level]].
With Unreal Engine 5 this was renamed from [[World Outliner]].

The [[Actor|Actors]] are organized in a hierarchy where they can be placed either inside folders or as children to each other.
Objects can be selected, renamed, grouped, hidden with the eye icon.
Move to a folder by selecting and either dragging to the folder or right-click and select either a folder or Create New Folder.
