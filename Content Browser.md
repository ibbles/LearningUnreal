Called Content Drawer in Unreal Engine 5. Kinda. The Content Drawer is a type of auto-hiding Content Browser.
We can open the Content Drawer with Ctrl+Space.

The Content Browser is the [[Unreal Editor]] panel where we can see the [[Asset|Asset]] that has been imported into or created inside our project.
Many assets are created from the right-click menu in the Content Browser, either in an empty space or on an Asset that can be used as a parent for new assets.
Asset are imported using the Import button at the top-left of the Content Browser.

Assets that has a visible representation, such as [[Static Mesh Asset]], [[Texture]], and [[Sound]] get an icon when the Content Browser > Settings > View Type has been set to Tiles.
Sometimes the preview isn't loaded, to force it right-click on the problematic asset.

We can move an [[Asset]] by selecting it and dragging it to the folder where we want it to be.
Unreal Engine tracks all asset references all will update them to point to the new location.
