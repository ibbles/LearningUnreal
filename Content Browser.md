Called Content Drawer in Unreal Engine 5.

The Content Browser is the [[Unreal Editor]] panel where we can see the [[Asset|Asset]] that has been imported into or created inside our project.
Many assets are created from the right-click menu in the Content Browser, either in an empty space or on an Asset that can be used as a parent for new assets.

We can open the Content Drawer with Ctrl+Space.
