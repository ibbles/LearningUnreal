The Content Browser is the [[Unreal Editor]] panel where we can see the [[Asset|Asset]] that has been imported into or created inside our project.
Many assets are created from the right-click menu in the Content Browser, either in an empty space or on an Asset that can be used as a parent for new assets.
Asset are imported using the Import button at the top-left of the Content Browser.

Assets that has a visible representation, such as [[Static Mesh Asset]], [[Texture]], and [[Sound]] get an icon when the Content Browser > Settings > View Type has been set to Tiles.
Sometimes the preview isn't loaded, to force it right-click on the problematic asset.

We can move an [[Asset]] by selecting it and dragging it to the folder where we want it to be.
Unreal Engine tracks all asset references all will update them to point to the new location.

Called Content Drawer in Unreal Engine 5. Kinda. The Content Drawer is a type of auto-hiding Content Browser.
We can open the Content Drawer with Ctrl+Space.


# Thumbnail Edit Mode

Some [[Asset|Assets]], such as  [[Texture]], [[Static Mesh Asset]], and [[Material]], will show a preview of the [[Asset]] in the Content Browser.
Some of those assets support customizing the preview.
For example, for a [[Static Mesh Asset]] we can control the point-of-view.
To enable Thumbnail Editing Mode do Content Browser > Settings > Thumbnail Edit Mode.
Click-and-drag on an [[Asset]] to orbit the camera.
Click Done Editing when done.
