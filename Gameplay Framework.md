The Gameplay Framework is a collection of core classes in Unreal Engine that make up the basis for any game.
The core engine startup and loop operate on these classes.
These classes define the rules and operations of the game,
and  how the player interacts with it and the world.
It is designed to be modular and with sane defaults,
meaning that any project only need to deal with the parts that particular project need to customize.

They are:
- [[Game Mode]]
- [[Game Instance]]
- [[Game State]]
- [[Player State]]
- [[Player Controller]]
- [[AI Controller]]
- [[Pawn]]
