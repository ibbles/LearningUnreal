Editor for texture coordinates of a [[Static Mesh]].
Select Tool Bar > Display > Display Background to show a pattern on the Static Mesh.

Contans an UV panel, a 2D viewport and a 3D viewport.
The UV panel contains a collection of tools.

Can create new UV channels, and copy texture coordinate between them.

# Edit

The Edit tool is used to move texture coordinates around.

Enable Select Islands is the top-middle of the 2D viewport.
Enable Select and Translate in the top-right of the 2D viewport.
Click to select and click-and-drag to move face islands in the 2D viewport.
See the results in the 3D viewport.

Unreal Engine 5.0:
Clicking in the 3D viewport doesn't select the corresponding island in the 2D viewport.
This makes finding the correct island a chore.
I expect improvements in future version of Unreal Engine.
