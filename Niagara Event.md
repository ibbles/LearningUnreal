A Niagara Event is used to communicate from one [[Niagara Emitter]] to another.
The event can carry data.

Events generated by the sending Emitter by a [[Niagara Module]] and are handled by the receiving Emitter by another Module.


# Sending Event

Send an event by adding an `<TYPE> Write` node to the sending [[Niagara Module]] by right-click  and select `Add <TYPE> Event Write`.
`<TYPE>` is the type to include in the event payload.
(
I think this is what is called a "Payload", as opposed to "Parameter",  in [[Project Settings]] > Plugins > Niagara.
)
If `<TYPE>` is a [[Blueprint Structure]] then it must first be registered in [[Project Settings]] > Plugins > Niagara > Additional Payload Types.
Hook the execution pins up so that the new node is reached when traversing from the Input Map node to the Output Module node.

The Write node provide input pins for the members in the type being sent, which is used to populate it with data.
Wires can be connected directly from the Write node to the Map Get node to create Module input parameters of the appropriate type.
The input variables can be renamed by double-clicking the name in the Map Get node and typing the new name.
The input variables show up in the Selection panel when an instance of the Module is selected in a [[Niagara Emitter]].



# Receiving Event

Receive an even by adding an `<TYPE> Read` node to the receiving [[Niagara Module]] by right-click and select `Add <TYPE> Event Read`.
Connect the execution pins.
The Read node provides an output pin for each member of the type received.



# Blueprint Structure

The data can be defined by a [[Blueprint Structure]].
I'm not sure what the limitations on members of the structure are.
The new type must be registered at [[Project Settings]] > Plugins > Niagara > Additional Parameter Types and Additional Payload Types.
I don't know what the difference between a Parameter and a Payload is yet.
