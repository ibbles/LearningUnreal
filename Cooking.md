Cooking is the act of converting [[Asset|Assets]] from the [[Unreal Editor]] format to the format used by the target platform.
Cooking is done when a [[Packaged Project]] is created, i.e. to create a distribution package that can be sent to end-users.
The cooked data will include parts of the [[Derived Data Cache]].
A packed project will not use the [[Derived Data Cache]], it will only use things included in the package.
