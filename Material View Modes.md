A [[View Mode]] is a replacement for the regular rendering, called Lit, in the [[Level Viewport]].
Material View Modes is the set of View Modes that are useful when developing and debugging a [[Material]].

The View Mode > Buffer Visualization > Overview mode displays a bunch of overlays showing the output from the [[Material]] for all parts of the scene, the buffers written by the [[Material]].
You can read more about the different buffers in [[Rendering Pipeline]].

The [[View Mode]] > Buffer Visualization > {Roughness, Metallic} View Mode shows the {roughness, metallic} values passed to the Roughness input pin of the [[Material Output Node]].
