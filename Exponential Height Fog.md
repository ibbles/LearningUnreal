Adds fog/haze to a scene.

You can control the density of the fog with both
Details panel > Exponential Height Fog Component > Fog Density
and
Details panel > Exponential Height Fog Component > Fog Height Falloff.
The falloff moves the fog in and out.

To make the immediate surroundings not foggy increase Details panel > Exponential Height Fog Component > Start Distance.
Beware that increasing this into a dense part of the fog will create a sharp transition.
