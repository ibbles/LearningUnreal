An Instanced Static Mesh Component is a Scene Component that renders a [[Static Mesh Asset]] multiple times at different locations.
Select a Static Mesh Asset either from the Details Panel or by calling the Set Static Mesh member function.
Add an instance by calling the Add Instance member function.
Each instance must have a [[Transform]].
