An editor for [[Texture]] settings.
Not the texture data itself, but for mip-map settings, compression, and things like that.

The maximum texture size can be set with Details panel > Compression > Advanced > Maximum Texture Size.
The engine will not load a mip level larger than this.
This is one way to limit the texture memory requirement without resizing the source texture data.
