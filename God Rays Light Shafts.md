God Rays is the effect of partially-occluded light illuminating fog, mist, dust, or other particles in the air.
The fog in the air can be provided by an [[Exponential Height Fog]] with the Volumetric Fog setting enabled.
The [[Light Source]] can, for example, be a [[Directional Light]].

On the Light enable Details panel > Light Shafts > Light Shaft Occlusion and Light Shaft Bloom.
Set Bloom Scale to taste.

To increase the God Rays effect produce by a light source, increase the Light > Volumetric Scattering Intensity in the Light's Details panel.

There is probably a density setting somewhere in the [[Exponential Height Fog]] Details panel.

Edit [[Exponential Height Fog]] > Details panel > Volumetric Fog > Scattering Distribution to control the look of the God Rays when viewed from different directions.
Values closer to 0.0 make the rays visible from any direction.
Values closer to 1.0 make the rays only visible when looking into the light source.
Close to 1.0 also makes the God Rays more "dreamy".
This is an art direction setting.
