A Scene Component is a type / subclass of [[Actor Component]].
A Scene Component has a placement in the [[Actor]], i.e. a location and a rotation.
The location and rotation can be either relative to the owning [[Actor]] or absolute in the world.
We can set the world location with the Set World Location node.
