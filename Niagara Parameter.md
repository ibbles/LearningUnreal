A Niagara Parameter is a piece of data that is exposed externally by a [[Niagara System]].
Blueprints and C++ code can read (I assume) and write the value held by a Parameter.

Create a new user parameter by clicking the + button next to User Parameters on the System node itself in the [[Node Graph Editor]].
