The Output Log panel is where we can see messages, warnings, and errors printed by either Unreal Engine, Unreal Editor, or the project.
Messages are white, warnings are orange, and errors are read.
Use the Filters drop-down menu to select which outputs to display.

When printing a string or text from a [[Blueprint Visual Script]] prepend either `warning: ` or `error: ` to make the printed text show up in either orange or red, respectively.
This only works for the Output Log panel, not the terminal.
