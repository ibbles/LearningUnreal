A [[Light Source]] that has a rectangular area and "flaps", called barn doors, on the sides.
The size of the Rect Light is controlled with Source Width and Source Height.
The size of the Rect Light is seen in reflections.
Acts like a soft box.
Gives soft diffuse lighting and shadows.
Good for portraits and cinematic work.

The shape of the light is controlled with the barn door properties at Details panel > Light > Barn Door Angle|Length.
With these we can make the light more  focused.

Intensity measured in candela.
