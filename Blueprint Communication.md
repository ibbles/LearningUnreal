[[Interactivity]]
[[Blueprint Interface]]

Objects within a [[Level]] can communicate via the [[Level Blueprint]].
In that case it's not really the objects that are communicating, it is the [[Level Blueprint]] that orchestrates everything.
Simple to set up, but code is difficult to re-use.
Should normally not be used much.
Only suitable when there is some functionality that  only makes sense within a single level.
