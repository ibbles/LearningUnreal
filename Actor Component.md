An Actor Component, often just Component, is something that is added to an Actor to provide some functionality.
A Component may have a transformation or not.
Components with a transformation inherit from Scene Component.

Scene Components exist in a hierarchy within the owning Actor.
When a Scene Component is transformed all its children will transform with it.
