Axis Events are continuous events that trigger every frame.
Another type of event are [[Action Events]].

With each event triggering is associated an axis value.
The axis value represent how far the axis has been moved from its neutral position.
Axis Events nodes have one execution output pin and one float output pin providing the axis value.
