Foliage Mode is an [[Editor Mode]] where we can place foliage.
We say that we paint foliage onto things.
Foliage is kinda like [[Instanced Static Mesh]], but with more features.

The paint cursor may become misaligned with the mouse cursor when piloting a [[Camera]] with a custom aspect ratio, such as a [[Cine Camera Actor]].
