Foliage Mode is an [[Editor Mode]] where we can place foliage.
We say that we paint foliage onto things.
Foliage is kinda like [[Instanced Static Mesh]], but with more features.

Note that there are two settings for density.
One is in the per-foliage type Details panel at the bottom of the Foliage panel.
One is the global Paint Density in the Paint > Brush Options of the Foliage panel.

There is a filter to control which type of things we can paint foliage on.
- Landscape
- Static Mesh
- Foliage
- BSP

The paint cursor may become misaligned with the mouse cursor when piloting a [[Camera]] with a custom aspect ratio, such as a [[Cine Camera]].
