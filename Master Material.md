A master material is a material that is intended to be instanced.
It provides a number of [[Material Parameter|Material Parameters]] that a [[Material Instance]] can tweak.
It is common that a project has a small set of master materials and a much larger set of [[Material Instance|Material Instances]].
In this way we only need to implement shared functionality once and reuse for many materials.

See [[Material Instance]].
