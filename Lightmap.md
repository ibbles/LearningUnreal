# Volumetric Lightmap
The Volumetric Lightmap can be visualized with Viewport > Show > Visualize > Volumetric Lightmap.
Will show up as spheres arranged in a regular grid in the world where there is a Lightmass Importance Volume.
(
I did not get this to show anything.
What is needed for the spheres to show up?
I have a [[Lightmass Importance Volume]] and a [[Point Light]] with [[Mobility]] set to Static.
I had to [[Baked Lighting|Bake Lighting]].
But the spheres are very very bright. As in the entire screen is while bright.
