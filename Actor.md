An Actor is the base class for everything that can exists within a [[Level]].
Not just graphics things, but also abstract thing such as [[Volumes|Volume]] or [[Controller|Controllers]].

We can **spawn** new Actor instances with the Spawn Actor From Class node.
We can **destroy** an Actor instance with the Destroy Actor node.
