A Landscape is how we create the ground in our environment.
It is a height field, which means that we can do hills and valleys but not caves or overhangs.

A Landscape is a hierarchical structure.
The top level is the Landscape itself.
The Landscape consists of Landscape Components.
Each Landscape Component consists of a number of Sections.
Each Section consists of a number of Quads.
