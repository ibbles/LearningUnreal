A Decal is a [[Texture]] / [[Material]] that is applied on top of another material.
It can be used for signs, cracks, bullet holes, graffiti, and similar.

Decals can be placed either as a Decal Actor in a Level or a Decal Component as part of an Actor.

A Decal is a box that projects the decal [[Texture]] / [[Material]] from one of the sides through the volume.
The Decal will be applied to whatever the volume overlaps, it doesn't need to be a part of the target or registered or anything like that.
Just overlap it.

The decal will mix with the [[Material]] it is being applied onto.
For example, the original normals will remain.

Decals have a separate section in the Quixel Megascans library.
