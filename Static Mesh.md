By "Static Mesh" me mean either a [[Static Mesh Asset]] or a [[Static Mesh Component]].
A [[Static Mesh Asset]] is a file on drive that contains a bunch of triangles and [[Material]] slots.
A [[Static Mesh Component]] brings a [[Static Mesh Asset]] into an Actor, causing the triangles of a [[Static Mesh Asset]] to be rendered.

[[Import Static Mesh]]
