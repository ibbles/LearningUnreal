A Level is a scene of sorts, a stage where we can put [[Actor|Actors]].
Closely related to [[Map]].
The difference between a Level and a [[Map]] is unclear to me.

Level is an [[Asset]] which means that they live in the [[Content Browser]].
Create a new Level by right-click in the [[Content Browser]] and select Level.

The main Unreal Editor windows is actually the [[Level Editor]] and the window showing the scene is the [[Level Viewport]].
When you open a Level by double-clicking it in the [[Content Browser]] then the Level currently open is closed and the double-clicked one is opened.

You can set the Level that is opened when you open your project in Unreal Editor and the Level that the game starts at in the [[Project Settings]], under Project > Maps & Modes > {Editor Startup Map, Game Default Map}.
