A Blueprint Function can take parameter **inputs** and return **outputs**.
The input and output values can be of the [[Blueprint Datatypes]].
With the function editor open add or remove inputs and outputs from the corresponding categories in the Details panel.
The inputs appear as output pins on the function's start node.
The outputs appear as input pins on the function's Return Node.
