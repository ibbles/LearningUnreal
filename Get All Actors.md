Get All Actors is a family of functions that collects Actors from the level based on some criteria.
The variants are:
- Get All Actors With Tag
- Get All Actors Of Class
- Get All Actors Of Class With Tag
- All All Actors With Interface

These are slow functions, don't call them every tick.

The Of Class variants returns a list of Actors of the appropriate type, so no casting is required.
