A View Mode is a visualization tool that can show various aspects of the rendering pipeline in the [[Level Viewport]].
By default the Level Viewport will render the level much like it would look in game, optionally with some extra billboards to show the location of non-rendered entities such as [[Light Sources]] and [[Sound]] sources.
This is called the Lit View Mode.
But the Level Viewport can visualize other things as well.
These are called View Modes and are accessed from one of the buttons in the top-left part of the viewport.
The button will display the currently selected View Mode, which by default is Lit.
Clicking this button gives you a list of the available View Modes.
You can read more about the performance related ones in [[Rendering Performance Profiling And Analysis]].
