A font is an [[Asset]] that describe how to render characters.
A font contains a font family, which is the shape of the glyphs.
This is what we often think of as a font.
The font family is often imported from a font file such as `.ttf`, or `.otf`.
Click the + button under Default Font Family to import a font file.
That becomes a separate [[Asset]] that is referenced by the font [[Asset]].

The default size of the font is set at [[Details Panel]] > Runtime Font > Legacy Font Size.
I don't know why it has "Legacy" in the name.
