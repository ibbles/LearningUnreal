The [[Unreal Editor]] contains a number of panels that can be arranged in different ways.
Each arrangement is called a layout.
Restore the default layout with Top Menu Bar > Window > Load Layout > Default Editor Layout.
You can save your own layouts to this list of loadable layouts using Top Menu Bar > Window > Save Layout > Save Layout As.
