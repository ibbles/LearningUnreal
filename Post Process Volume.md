Add [[Post Processing]] to an area of the map, or an entire level by enabling Infinite Extent (Unbounded).
An Actor that define a volume in a level in which a [[Post Processing]] should be applied.
The volume can either be bounded, i.e. only apply within a cube, or unbounded, also called Infinite Extent, i.e., applied everywhere.
It is the position of the camera that determine of a Post Process Volume is active or not, not the position of the thing being rendered.
One cannot see the effect when looking into a Post Process Volume, but one can see it when looking out.
