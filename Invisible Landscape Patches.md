The [[Landscape Mode]] [[Sculpt a Landscape|sculpt tab]] contains a Visibility tool.
Painting with this tool makes patches of the [[Landscape]] completely invisible.
Click-and-drag to paint invisibility, hold shift while painting to remove invisibility.

The [[Material]] set on the Landscape must have [[Blend Mode]] set to Masked and must use a Landscape Visibility Mask node connected to the Opacity Mask input on the [[Material Output Node]].

Parts of the [[Landscape]] that has been made invisible does not generate collisions.
