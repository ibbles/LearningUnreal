Input Mode is a setting on the [[Player Controller]].
It can be either UI Only or Game Only, or both (I assume.).
The UI Only mode is commonly enabled when displaying a menu or an overlay UI element such as an inventory or skill tree screen.
When switching to UI Only it is common to also call Set Show Mouse Cursor true on the Player Controller.
And vice versa when switching to Game Only.
