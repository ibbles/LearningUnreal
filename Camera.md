A Camera define how we look at the scene while playing.
It has a position, orientation, and a field of view.
And also a bunch of other properties that control the way the scene is presented.

A Camera Component can be part of many types of Actors.
It is common to make it part of a [[Pawn]].
To get a third-person view it is common to attach the camera to a [[Spring Arm Component]].
