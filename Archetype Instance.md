An Archetype Instance is an instance created from an [[Archetype]].
Used by the [[Blueprint]] code to associate [[Property]] values in the [[Blueprint]] with [[Property]] values of the instances of that [[Blueprint]] in the [[Level]].
There are also additional behind-the-scenes Archetype Instances, for example used by the [[Viewport]] in the [[Blueprint Editor]].
