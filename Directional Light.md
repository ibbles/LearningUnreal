A Directional Light is a type of [[Light Source]].
A Directional Light is a light source that only has a direction.
The position doesn't matter, the entire scene is affected by the Directional Light equally, except for objects in shadow.
The direction is controlled with the light's Rotation.
It simulates light coming for infinitely far away, i.e., parallel light rays.
Often used for sunlight, since the sun is very far away, or moonlight, since the moon is also far away.
Often used for exterior environment or indoor environments with sunlight through a window.

Create a new Directional Light by dragging it in from the Place Actors panel, or using the [[Environment Light Mixer]].

The direction of the Directional Light in a level can be changed by pressing Ctrl+L and moving the mouse.
Not sure how it chooses which Directional Light to change the direction of.
