A Directional Light is one of the available [[Light Sources]] in Unreal Engine.
A Directional Light is a light source that only has a direction.
The position doesn't matter.
It simulates light coming for infinitely far away, i.e., parallel light rays.
Often used for sunlight, since the sun is very far away.

The direction of the Directional Light in a level can be changed by pressing Ctrl+L and moving the mouse.
Not sure how it chooses which Directional Light to change the direction of.
