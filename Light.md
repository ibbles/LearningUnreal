Lights produces [[Lighting]] that illuminates objects, making them visible.
Obscuring light causes shadows on the objects that would have been lit if the light would not have been obscured.
Unreal Engine has [[Static Lighting]] and [[Dynamic Lighting]].
Static means that the lighting calculations are done at build time, before the application is shipped to end-users.
Dynamic means that the lighting calculations are done at run-time, on the end-user's hardware.
Static lighting is limited in what can be changed at runtime, a [[Light Source]] can't be moved, for example.
With dynamic lighting any setting can be changed at runtime.
Unreal Engine's dynamic lighting system is [[Lumen]].
Light is produces by one or more [[Light Source|Light Sources]].
