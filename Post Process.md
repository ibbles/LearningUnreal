#PostProcess

Change the look of your scene.
There can only be one Post Process active at the time.
If there are multiple Post Process that want to be active at the same time then the one with the highest Priority is used.
A Post Process has a Blend Weight, making it possible get a combination of multiple Post Processes.
(
Don't know how Priority and Blend Weight work together.
Does it only blend Post Processes with the same Priority?
