A Timer is a way to schedule work to be done in the future.

Use a Set Timer By Event node to have a [[Blueprint Event]] be triggered at some point in the future.
The Set Timer By Event node has an Event input pin, marked with a red square.
[[Blueprint Event]] nodes have a corresponding red square next to their title.
Connecting the red square on the [[Blueprint Event]] node to the red square on the Set Timer By Event node causes that [[Blueprint Event]] to be called when the timer runs out.
One can drag from the Event input pin on the Set Timer By Event node and select Create Custom Event to create a new [[Blueprint Event]] node.
