# Breakpoints
Create or remove a breakpoint on a node either by right-clicking and selecting Toggle Breakpoint, or by selecting the node and pressing F9.

# Watches
Right-click a node pin and select Wathi This Value.
Then, when a Play In Editor session is open, select an instance of the Blueprint Class from the Debug Filter in the Tool Bar of the [[Blueprint Editor]].
The last value that the pin had will be shown in a tool-tip.
Remove the watch by clicking the icon next to the pin.

# Print String
Values and debug messages can be printed with the Print String node.
The string will be printed to the top-left corner of the [[Viewport]] and to the console.
