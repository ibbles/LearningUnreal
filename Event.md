An Event is something that happens and that objects can be notified about.
There are many types of events:
- [[Input Event]]: Things the player does, such as typing on a keyboard or moving a joystick.
- [[Input Action]]: The [[Enhanced Input]] variant of an [[Input Event]].
- [[Blueprint Event]]: Game logic events that trigger a [[Blueprint Visual Script]] to execute.
- [[Custom Event]]: An event type created by a game designer and triggered by gameplay logic.

Related to events are [[Delegate]]s.
