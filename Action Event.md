An Action Event is an [[Input Event]] that trigger an Action.
Actions are discrete in the sense that they are either happening or not happening, there is not half-happening Actions.
This is in contrast to [[Axis Event]].

Action Event [[Blueprint Visual Script]] nodes have two execution pins, one for Pressed and one for Released.
[[Action Event In C++]] are listened for in a [[Player Controller]] subclass.
