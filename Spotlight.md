A [[Light Source]] that has both a location and a rotation.
It emits light in a cone around the light's local X axis.
Kinda like a flashlight.
The Details panel has Inner Cone Angle and Outer Cone Angle.
The Inner Cone Angle is the angle of the full-light cone.
This area get the full intensity of the light.
The Outer Cone Angle is the angle of the no-light threshold cone.
The area outside of this cone get no light.
The circle between the Inner Cone Angle and the Outer Cone Angle get less and less light the closer to the Outer Cone Angle.

The intensity unit for  Spotlight is candela.
