The Blueprint Editor is where we edit our Blueprint Classes.

The Blueprint Editor contains the My Blueprint panel.
The My Blueprint panel contains the [[Blueprint Variables]] that the class contains.

The Blueprint Editor contains the [[Event Graph]].
The [[Event Graph]] is where the logic of our class is defined.
