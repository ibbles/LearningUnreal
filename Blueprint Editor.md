The Blueprint Editor is where we edit our Blueprint Classes.
The main parts are the Viewport, the [[Event Graph]], the Components, My Blueprint, and [[Details Panel]].
There are also additional windows such as the Class Defaults, Class Settings, and Construction Script.

The Details panel display the properties of the currently selected Component, variable, function, or macro.

# My Blueprint Panel
The Blueprint Editor contains the My Blueprint panel.
The My Blueprint panel contains the [[Blueprint Variable]] that the class contains.
To see inherited variables you must click the eye at the top of the My Blueprint panel and check Show Inherited Variables.

# Event Graph
The Blueprint Editor contains the [[Event Graph]].
The [[Event Graph]] is where the logic of our class is defined.

# Components Panel
A hierarchy/list of all the Actor Components in the Actor.
Scene Components are in the hierarchy.
Non-Scene Actor Components are in the list below the Scene Component hierarchy.
