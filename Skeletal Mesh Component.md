A Skeletal Mesh Component is how we add a [[Skeletal Mesh Asset]] to an [[Actor]].

From a [[Material]] in the Skeletal Mesh we can create a [[Dynamic Material Instance]] with the **Create Dynamic Material** Instance node.
The node takes an Element Index that is the index of the material slot holding the [[Material]] we want to create an instance for.

We can tell a Skeletal Mesh to run an [[Animation]] by executing the Play [[Montage]] node.
