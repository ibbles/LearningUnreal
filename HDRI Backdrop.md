I provided by a plugin with the same name.

A cube map that provides omnidirectional incoming light.
Kind of light a sky light.
It actually contains a Sky Light and a dome mesh with a texture.
Can provide good base lighting and environment, but shouldn't be the main light source.

Moving the projection center makes the HDRI Backdrop warp in weird ways.
