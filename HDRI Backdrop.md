I provided by a plugin with the same name.

A cube map that provides omnidirectional incoming light.
Kind of like a sky light. No, exactly like a Sky Light.
It actually contains a Sky Light and a dome mesh with a texture.
Can provide good base lighting and environment, but shouldn't be the main light source.

Moving the projection center makes the HDRI Backdrop warp in weird ways.

The Sky Light can use Hardware Raytraced Shadows.
