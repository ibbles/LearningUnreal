[[Ambient Occlusion]] is a way to fake indirect lighting and/or small scale occlusion on a lit object.
It works by estimating how much light is obstructed per pixel (?) by nearby geometry and reduce the light intensity by that amount.
This produces darkened corners and crevices.
It give more definition to the mesh.

Unreal Engine has:
- [[Distance Field Ambient Occlusion]].
	- This is a feature on the [[Sky Light]].
- [[Baked Ambient Occlusion]]
	- This is generated at bake time by [[Lightmass]], only for static lights and objects.
- [[Post Processing]] Ambient Occlusion.
	- This is generated by the regular real-time rendering pipeline.
	- It can be disabled with a [[Post Process Volume]] by setting [[Post Process Volume]] > [[Details Panel]] > Rendering Features > Ambient Occlusion > Intensity to 0.0.

These effects can stack, which may produce dark corners.
Consider disabling [[Post Processing]] Ambient Occlusion, i.e. setting Intensity to 0.0 in  a [[Post Process Volume]], if you are also using other forms of Ambient Occlusion.
