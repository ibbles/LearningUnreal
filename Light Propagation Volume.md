A technique to achieve dynamic [[Global Illumination]].
Alternatives include [[Lumen]], another dynamic [[Global Illumination]] implementation, and [[Lightmass]], which is a baked technique that produces [[Lightmap|Lightmaps]].

Has less detail than [[Lightmass]], but supports dynamic [[Light Sources]] and [[Actor|Actors]].
Not sure how it compares to [[Lumen]]. Does [[Lumen]] replace Light Propagation Volume?
