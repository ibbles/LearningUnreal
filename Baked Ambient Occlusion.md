A form of [[Ambient Occlusion]] that is generated by [[Lightmass]] during light baking.
Is only applied for static [[Light Source|Light Sources]] and static [[Mesh|Meshes]].

It is configured from [[World Settings]] > Lightmass.
Enable [[World Settings]] > Lightmass > Use Ambient Occlusion,
and tweak the related settings.
No idea how these settings should be set.

A dynamic form of [[Ambient Occlusion]] is [[Distance Field Ambient Occlusion]].
