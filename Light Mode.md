The Light Mode is an [[Unreal Editor]] debug/visualization feature.
It sidesteps the normal rendering and renders some specific aspect of the scene instead.

The Light Mode is changed from a nameless button in the top-left corner of the main [[Viewport]].
The title of the button is the current Light Mode, which by default is Lit.

Some of the Light Modes available:

- Lit. The default light mode. Things are rendered using their configured [[Material|Materials]] and with the [[Light]] sources available in the level.
- Unlit. No light sources are considered. Everything is rendered as-if uniformly lit.
