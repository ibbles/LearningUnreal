Quixel Bridge is a tool for importing assets from the [[Quixel Megascans]] library into an Unreal Engine project.
Starting with Unreal Engine 5 .0  the Quixel Bridge plugin is shipped with the engine.
Assets can be imported with Content Browser > right-click > Add Quixel Content. Quixel Bridge opens.
Use the search bar at the top of the tree view to the left to find assets to import.
The assets are grouped into a number of categories, such as [[Quixel Megascans Surfaces|Surfaces]] and [[Quixel Megascans 3D Assets|3D Assets]].
Quixel Megascans assets imported imported from Quixel Bridge are stored in the `Megascans` folder of the Content Browser.


# Asset Quality

Quixel Megascans assets are available in multiple quality levels.


# Settings

Clicking the settings button (sliders / hamburger with dots) next to the quality drop-down opens the settings window.

The settings window contains the Create Material Blend button.
This creates a blend [[Material]] from the Quixel Surface Assets currently selected in the Content Browser.
For more information see [[Quixel Megascans Surfaces]] and [[Quixel Megascans Surfaces Material Blend]].
