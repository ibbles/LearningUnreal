Lighting, the process of adding [[Light]], is what makes it possible to see the objects in our level.
Lighting can be either [[Dynamic Lighting|Dynamic]] or [[Static Lighting|Static]], which can be [[Baked Lighting|Baked]].
Lighting is provided by one or more [[Light Sources]].

The Global Illumination method used for dynamic lighting is set in Project Settings > Engine > Rendering > Global Illumination > Dynamic Global Illumination Method.
This is where [[Lumen]] is enabled.
