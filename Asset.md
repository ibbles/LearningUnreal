An Asset is data that exists as part of the project on drive.
Asset contains things such as [[Texture|Textures]], [[Material|Materials]], [[Sound]], [[Static Mesh Asset|Static Mesh]], [[Skeletal Mesh Asset|Skeletal Meshes]], [[Blueprint Class|Blueprint Classes]], and so on.
We can see our assets in the [[Content Browser]].

Many types of assets are created in an external tool, called a Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool, and imported into the Unreal Editor.
To import an asset, click the Import button at the top of the Content Browser.
The import process will convert the asset from the source format to Unreal Engine's own format.

Some types of assets can be created directly inside the Unreal Editor:
- [[Static Mesh]], using the [[Modeling Mode]].
- [[Sound]] using [[MetaSounds]].

Some types of assets can be imported into the project from [[Quixel Bridge]] or the [[Unreal Marketplace]].


Unreal Engine tracks all asset references in the project.
This means that we can move assets between folders in the [[Content Browser]] and all references to that asset will be updated.
