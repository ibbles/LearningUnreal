An Asset is data that exists as part of the project on drive.
Asset contains things such as [[Texture|Textures]], [[Material|Materials]], sound, [[Static Mesh Asset|Static Mesh]], [[Skeletal Mesh|Skeletal Meshes]], [[Blueprint ClassBlueprint Classes]], and so on.

Many types of assets are created in an external tool, called a Digital Content Creation (DCC) tool, and imported into the Unreal Editor.
To import an asset, click the Import button at the top of the Content Drawer.
The import process will convert the asset from the source format to Unreal Engine's own format.
