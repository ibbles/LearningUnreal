The Editor Scalability Settings control various rendering quality controls within the Unreal Editor.
Use these to improve your in-editor frame rate while building your project.
Modifying these do not change anything in a packaged executable. (I think.)

In Unreal Engine 5 do Top Menu Bar > Settings > Engine Scalability Settings.

The settings contains presets for Low, Medium, High, Epic, and Cinematic.
There is also a slider for [[Resolution Scale]].
In addition to the presets the same quality options exists for individual rendering features such as view distance, [[Shadows]], and [[Post Processing]].
