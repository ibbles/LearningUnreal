Each Level has its own World Settings and they override the corresponding entry in the Project Settings.

Open the World Settings panel with [[Top Menu Bar]] > Window > World Settings.

The World Settings contains a [[Game Mode]] override.
This makes it possible to let some levels use a [[Game Mode]] other than the project default one, set in the [[Project Settings]].

There are settings for [[Lightmass]].

There is a setting for destroying any [[Actor]] that falls below the Fall Z height.

[[World Partition]] streaming can be enabled or disabled.

Landscape settings.
