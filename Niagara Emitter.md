A Niagara Emitter is a piece of a [[Niagara System]].
The emitter is responsible for spawning new particles.
An emitter consists of [[Niagara Module|Niagara Modules]].
The modules define the behavior or the emitter.

To create a new emitter within the [[Niagara Editor]] right-click the System Overview and select Add Emitter.
Or hit `E` on the keyboard.
A list of templates is presented.
A template is an emitter that comes with a set of modules already added.
All modules added by the template can be removed, it doesn't matter which template you create an emitter from.
(I think.)
