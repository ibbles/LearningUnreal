The Blueprint Component Editor is similar to the [[Blueprint Actor Editor]], but somewhat scaled down.
There is no Components panel and no [[Viewport]].
There is a My Blueprint panel with graphs, [[Blueprint Function]]s, macros, [[Blueprint Variable]]s and [[Event Dispatcher]]s.
There is a [[Node Graph Editor]].
