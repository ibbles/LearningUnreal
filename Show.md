Show is a button in the top-left corner of the [[Level Viewport]], next to the [[View Mode]] button.
In the Show menu we can enable or disable rendering of extra information in our [[Level Viewport]], such as [[Mesh Distance Field]], [[Collision Shape]], [[Navigation Mesh]], and more.
This menu can also be used to disable rendering of things that are normally rendered, such as [[Decal]], [[Landscape]], [[Static Mesh]], and [[Skeletal Mesh]].
