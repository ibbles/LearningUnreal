The console is a CLI interface to many of the low-level features of Unreal Engine.
The console can be used to set [[Console Variable|Console Variables]] and run [[Console Command]].
The console is available
- UE5: at the bottom of the Unreal Editor window.
- UE4: at the bottom of the Console Log panel.

The console can also be opened with the `<backtick>` Keyboard shortcut.

Don't know how to write a backtick in an in line code block in markdown.
`\` doesn't seem to be escape.
