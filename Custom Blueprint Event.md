Custom Events are kind of like functions.
They are the root of a Visual Script execution graph.
Calling the Event will execution the graph nodes rooted at the Custom Event node.
A Custom Event can have parameters.

Custom Events are used to notify a Blueprint Class that something has happened or that something should be done.

Custom Blueprint Events are events that we define ourselves.
One type of event is [[Input Bindings]] created in the Project Settings.
One type of event is [[Custom Event]] created directly in the Event Graph.
