There is a family of functions named Draw Deubg SHAPE where shape can be one of
- Point
- Line
- Plane
- Circle
- Sphere
- Cone
- Capsule
- Cylinder
- Box
- Arrow
- Coordinate system
- Frustum
- String
- Camera

There is also two variants of Float History that I don't know what it is yet.

These are used to visualize spatial information that we need for development.
It is not mean for use in the final game.
