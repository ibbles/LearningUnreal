Action events are [[Input Events]] that trigger an Action.
Actions are discrete in the sense that they are either happening or not happening, there is not half-happening Actions.
This is in contrast to [[Axis Events]].

Action Event nodes have two execution pins, one for Pressed and one for Released.
