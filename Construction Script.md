A [[Blueprint Class]] may have a Construction Script.
This is similar to a C++ constructor in that it is run when an instance of the class is created.
A Construction Script is implemented as a [[Blueprint Visual Script]], very much like any other [[Blueprint Function]].
Remember to call the Parent Construction Script.
There is a tab in the [[Blueprint Editor]] for the Construction Script.
The tab can be re-opened by double-clicking My Blueprint panel > Functions > ConstructionScript.
