The Level Viewport is the part of the [[Level Editor]] where we can see the contents of our level.

Press and hold Ctrl and type L, keep holding Ctrl, and move the mouse to rotate the Directional Light in the level.

With an [[Actor]] selected, type End to place it on whatever is beneath it.

The Level Viewport can be in one of several [[View Modes]], where Lit is the default one.
