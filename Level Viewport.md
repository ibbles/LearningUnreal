The Level Viewport is the part of the [[Level Editor]] where we can see the contents of our level.

There are various [[Viewport Camera Controls]].

There are several debug and performance [[View Mode|View Modes]].
Various statistics can be show on the Level Viewport with the [[Stat]] command.

Press and hold Ctrl and type L, keep holding Ctrl, and move the mouse to rotate the Directional Light in the level.

With an [[Actor]] selected, type End to place it on whatever is beneath it.
